<p>The first cats could be ones like Sabertooth tigers, which is very, very, EXTREMELY interesting. (And dangerous.) :(</p>
<h2>Cats of Today</h2><p>The cats of today can also be very cute, not unlike the Sabertooth tiger, but some might say that the tiger is a little LESS cuddly. Why? </p>
<p>We will tell you plainly. Sabertooth tigers are DANGEROUS. You should never pet one. (Unless it is a bottle fed Sabertooth tiger, but even then, it could SEVERELY hurt you.)</p>
